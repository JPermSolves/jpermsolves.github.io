					<h3>Abric United Breeze Past Se in Title Race</h3>
					<p class="w3-serif">Abric United and Se have been battling it out for the chance of winning the title. In a game that kicked off in Abric, Se have little hope. With two minutes on the clock, Abric United won a penalty. Thomas sent it far to the right and Abric United fans all over Sailopia were distraught. With a quick goal from Se, it seemed as if they would take all 3 points. After around 15 minutes, Tawhisky had a total of 5 big misses. Finally, he netted in around the 30th minute. After the first half, it was anyone's guess who would win. However, Tawhisky scored on a breakaway to make it 2-1. Høberg smashed the ball from a distance into the top right corner and Tawhisky got a scorpion kick. It finished 6-1 for the Purples.</p>
